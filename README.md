# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Here you will find my recent projects showcasing my technical and business acumen in data anaylsis, strategic planning, and client presentations. 

## Project 1: Identifying User Cohorts and Predicting Conversions using Linear Regression 

This project showcases my ability to form hypotheses, perform in-depth data analysis and linear regression using R code,  transform findings into visualizations in Tableau, construct operational dashboards, and offer strategic recommendations to optimize marketing campaigns and UX based on data.

#### Summary 
Our client wants to identify key predictors of whether a user will convert (purchase a product) so they can optimize their marketing campaign strategies and website conversion funnel. 

In particular, they want to understand:
- optimal target audience
- best time of year to ramp up campaigns for maximum ROI
- current most valuable pages, so they can focus on improving conversion rates through CRO best practices

In addition to this analysis, they also want an operational dashboard to monitor performance as they start fine-tuning their strategies based on these findings.

#### There are three deliverables:
1. Data exploration and anaylsis using R code in Jupyter Notebooks
2. Tableau dash for monitoring performance
3. Client presentation, including findings and recommendations
