# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Here you will find my recent projects showcasing my technical and business acumen in data anaylsis, strategic planning, and client presentations. 

## Project 1: Identifying User Cohorts and Predicting Conversions using Linear Regression 

This project showcases my ability to perform in-depth data analysis using R code, transform findings into visualizations in Tableau, and offer data-driven recommendations to optimize marketing and CRO strategies.

#### Summary 
Our client wants to identify key predictors of whether a user will convert (purchase a product) so they can optimize their marketing campaign strategies and website conversion funnel. 

In particular, they want to understand:
- optimal target audience
- best time of year to ramp up campaigns for maximum ROI

In addition to this analysis, they also want an operational dashboard to monitor performance as they start fine-tuning their strategies based on these findings.

#### There are three deliverables:
1. [Data exploration and anaylsis using R code in Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/krista-lowry/portfolio/blob/main/r-code-markdown.ipynb)
2. [Tableau dash for monitoring performance](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/krista.lowry/viz/OnlineShopperIntent-TableauDash/Performance)
3. Client presentation, including findings and recommendations (COMING SOON)
