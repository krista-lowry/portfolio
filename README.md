Identifying User Cohorts and Predicting Conversions using Linear Regression 

This project showcases my ability to form hypotheses, perform in-depth data analysis and linear regression using R code,  transform findings into visualizations in Tableau, construct operational dashboards, and offer strategic recommendations to optimize marketing campaigns and UX based on data.

Project 1 Landing Page: Summary 
Our client wants to identify key predictors of whether a user will convert (purchase a product) so they can optimize their marketing campaigns and user experience. Before they start building out a site experience that encourages browsing specific pages, they want to conduct data analysis to confirm their hypothesis.
Then they want a dashboard to monitor performance with key predictors in mind.
